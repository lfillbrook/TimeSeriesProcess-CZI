"""
Designed to process time series data collected on a Zeiss confocal microscope from microfluidic flow experiments.

Data collection: A line scan is selected at one point along the microfluidics channel; the line scan is repeated 
to create a time series experiment. Time series experiments are repeated for a control (in which the fluorescence 
intensity profile should be flat), followed by 2 experiments in which the fluorescence intensity profile is 
expected to be perturbed. The experiments are obtained at different flow rates, to lead to different residence 
times at the same point along the microfluidics channel.

Data storage: Each flow rate has itâ€™s own directory, inside which the 3 time series experiments (control, and two 
others) are saved as CZI files. The control always appears at the top of the direction, alphabetically, by 
appropriate file naming (important for processing).

Using script: Run Cell 0 to set up processing for all flow rates (defining lists: dsets and FR is important for 
comparing across flow rates); only run once at the beginning. Import and check the averaged data across each time 
series in a single directory (flow rate) by running Cell 1, and normalizing with Cell 2. If the data is acceptable, 
use Cell 3 to store the data and flow rate (in dsets and FR, respectively). Repeat Cells 1-3 for each directory. 
Once all of the directories of interest have been imported, checked, normalized and stored (using Cells 1-3), run 
Cell 4 to plot a comparison of the results across directories, which in this case comprises of results at different 
flow rates.

    L : float
        length along channel where images were collected (in cm).
    w : float, optional
        width of channel (in cm). The default is 360.
    h : float, optional
        height of channel (in cm). The default is 50.

    Returns
    -------
    resTime : float
        residence time of the solution in the channel at the point
        where the images are collected.
